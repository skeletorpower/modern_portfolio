                <p>My name is Aleksandar Novic and I am a Junior Web Developer and Software Tester. </br>I guess you want to know a bit more about me, huh? I'm not all that good at talking about myself, but I'll give it a shot :) </br></br>I consider myself to be a Web Developer, because I like doing that. Programming in general is a sphere that interests me and the whole process of creating something. I like solving problems in IT and use my skills to help others. One of the traits about me that I find important is that I'm very friendly and relaxed person, and also easy to work with.</br></br>But enough about me, how about you? Whats up? :) Feel free to reach me on <a href="contact.html"><span>Contact page</span></a>.</p>
